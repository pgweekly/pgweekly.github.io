I need you to act as a PostgreSQL expert and technical writer to generate a high-quality blog post from a PostgreSQL mailing list thread.

**Instructions:**

1. **Fetch the thread data:**
   - Run: `python3 tools/fetch_data.py --thread-id "PASTE_YOUR_THREAD_ID_HERE"`
   - This will download the HTML, convert to Markdown, and save attachments

2. **Analyze the content:**
   - Read the converted Markdown file in `data/threads/YYYY-MM-DD/<thread-id>/thread.md`
   - Review the original HTML if you need more context
   - Check the `attachments/` folder for any patch files
   - If there are multiple patch versions (v1, v2, v3, etc.), use `diff` to understand what changed between versions

3. **Generate TWO versions of the technical blog post (English and Chinese):**

   **Both versions should include:**
   - **Clear title:** Based on the main topic discussed
   - **Introduction:** Brief context and why this matters
   - **Technical Analysis:**
     - Key discussion points and decisions
     - Code examples or patch highlights (if relevant)
     - Evolution of the solution (compare patch versions if multiple exist)
   - **Community Insights:**
     - Important reviewer feedback
     - Issues discovered and how they were resolved
   - **Technical Details:**
     - Implementation approaches
     - Edge cases discussed
     - Performance considerations (if any)
   - **Current Status:** Where the patch/discussion stands
   - **Conclusion:** Summary and implications for PostgreSQL users

4. **Writing guidelines:**
   - **English version:** Professional technical writing style, clear explanations for complex concepts
   - **Chinese version (中文版本):**
     - Professional technical writing in Chinese
     - Maintain technical accuracy with proper terminology
     - Use 中文 for explanations but keep code/SQL examples in original form
     - Natural Chinese technical writing style (不要直译，要符合中文技术文章习惯)
   - **Both versions:**
     - Code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
     - Links to relevant documentation or references

5. **Save the blogs:**
   - Determine the appropriate year and week number based on the thread date or current date
   - Generate a descriptive filename based on the content (e.g., `pg-get-role-ddl-functions`)
   - **Create directories if needed and save TWO files:**
     - `src/en/{year}/{week}/{filename}.md` - English version
     - `src/cn/{year}/{week}/{filename}.md` - Chinese version (中文版本)
   - Update `src/SUMMARY.md` to include BOTH blog entries in their respective language sections
   - Update both language week README files if they don't exist:
     - `src/en/{year}/{week}/README.md`
     - `src/cn/{year}/{week}/README.md`

   - **Example SUMMARY.md format:**
     ```markdown
     # 🇬🇧 English
     - [2026](./en/2026/README.md)
       - [Week 03](./en/2026/03/README.md)
         - [Topic Name](./en/2026/03/topic-name.md)

     # 🇨🇳 中文
     - [2026](./cn/2026/README.md)
       - [第 03 周](./cn/2026/03/README.md)
         - [主题名称](./cn/2026/03/topic-name.md)
     ```

**Additional Context:**
- You have full access to all downloaded files in the thread directory
- Use your PostgreSQL expertise to provide valuable insights
- Focus on technical accuracy and clarity
- Highlight what developers and DBAs should know about this discussion
- **Year/Week determination:** Check the thread's date in metadata.txt or use the current date to determine the appropriate year and ISO week number for organizing the blog

Please start by fetching the data and then generate the blog post.
